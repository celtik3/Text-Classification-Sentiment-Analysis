## Text Classification - Sentiment Analysis 

This project implements a full NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie reviews dataset. It includes both a traditional Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression) and a Deep Learning model (LSTM) built with pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings.

### Key Features

- **Dataset**: IMDB movie reviews (binary sentiment) from Kaggle
- **Preprocessing**: NLTK-based tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - LSTM (deep learning with embeddings)
- **Embeddings**: Pre-trained Word2Vec with custom embedding matrix
- **Evaluation**: Compared models based on validation accuracy and loss
